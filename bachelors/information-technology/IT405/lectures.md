## Lectures

## Lecture 1: The Capstone Vision — What Makes a Great Project

### 1.1 Overview

What distinguishes a great capstone from a mediocre one? This lecture establishes criteria: technical depth, real-world relevance, demonstrated mastery of core competencies, and professional-quality deliverables. Students explore past capstone examples and begin ideating their own projects.

### 1.2 Key Topics

- **Evaluation Criteria:** (1) **Technical depth** — does the project demonstrate advanced IT skills beyond basic CRUD applications? (2) **Real-world relevance** — does it solve an actual problem or address a genuine need? (3) **Core competency coverage** — does it span multiple domains (systems, networking, security, databases, automation)? (4) **Professional quality** — would you show this to an employer?
- **Project Categories:** (1) **Infrastructure automation** — building CI/CD pipelines, self-service platforms, monitoring systems; (2) **Security architecture** — zero-trust implementation, security operations platform, threat detection; (3) **Data platform** — database cluster with HA/DR, data pipeline, analytics platform; (4) **Edge/IoT system** — distributed sensor network with edge processing; (5) **Service management** — ITSM platform, automated incident management; (6) **Research** — empirical study of IT practices, novel architecture evaluation.
- **Past Exemplars:** (1) "Yggdrasil Monitor" — an AI-driven observability platform predicting failures in the university's infrastructure; (2) "Ragnarök Recovery" — automated DR orchestration achieving 4-minute RTO; (3) "Freyja's Firewall" — zero-trust microsegmentation for a simulated enterprise.

### 1.3 Required Reading

### 1.4 Discussion Questions
1. How do you balance ambition with feasibility when scoping a capstone project?
2. What are the dangers of choosing a project that is too narrow (only tests one skill) versus too broad (never finishes)?
3. How can you leverage your capstone to demonstrate skills that employers in your target field actually care about?

## Lecture 2: Requirements Discovery — Understanding What to Build

### 2.1 Overview

The most common cause of project failure is building the wrong thing. This lecture covers requirements discovery: stakeholder interviews, user stories, use cases, functional and non-functional requirements, and the art of distinguishing needs from wants.

### 2.2 Key Topics

- **Requirements Elicitation Techniques:** (1) stakeholder interviews; (2) observation of current workflows; (3) document analysis; (4) competitive analysis of existing solutions; (5) prototyping and feedback. By 2040, AI-assisted requirements analysis suggests overlooked requirements based on similar projects.
- **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements:** Functional: what the system does. Non-functional: how well it does it — performance, reliability, security, scalability, maintainability, usability. Non-functional requirements are frequently neglected but often determine project success. Example: "The monitoring system shall detect anomalies within 30 seconds (non-functional) and provide root cause hypotheses with >85% accuracy (functional)."
- **Prioritization:** MoSCoW method: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have (this iteration). Forces explicit prioritization — everything can't be highest priority. Helps manage scope creep.

### 2.3 Required Reading
- Wiegers, K., & Beatty, J. (2038). *Software Requirements* (4th ed.). Microsoft Press.

### 2.4 Discussion Questions
1. How do you handle conflicting requirements from different stakeholders?
2. What techniques exist for uncovering latent needs that stakeholders cannot articulate?
3. How does the MoSCoW method change when you have a hard deadline versus flexible timing?

## Lecture 3: Architecture Design — From Requirements to Blueprint

### 3.1 Overview

Architecture transforms requirements into a technical blueprint. This lecture covers architecture design: architectural drivers, design patterns, trade-off analysis, and the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) practice.

### 3.2 Key Topics

- **Architecture Drivers:** (1) functional requirements; (2) quality attribute requirements (the "-ilities": reliability, scalability, security, maintainability); (3) constraints (budget, timeline, technology, compliance); (4) architectural principles and conventions. The architect's job: satisfy the drivers within the constraints.
- **Documenting Architecture:** (1) C4 model — Context (system in its environment), Container (high-level components), Component (within containers), Code (implementation details); (2) Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) — document significant decisions with context, options considered, rationale, and consequences; (3) Diagrams as code — use PlantUML, Mermaid, or Structurizr DSL so diagrams are version-controlled and reviewable.
- **Trade-off Analysis:** Every architectural decision involves trade-offs. The Architecture Trade-off Analysis Method (ATAM): (1) identify architectural approaches; (2) generate quality attribute utility tree; (3) analyze approaches against scenarios; (4) identify sensitivities (attributes affected by the decision), trade-offs (decisions that improve one attribute at the expense of another), and risks.

### 3.3 Required Reading

2. How do you communicate architectural trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders?
3. What are the limitations of the C4 model, and when would you use a different architectural diagramming approach?
